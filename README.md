# CoviShare - One stop resources sharing solution amidst the COVID pandemic.

CoviShare is an Express web application that is built to provide a common platform for sharing resources amongst the ones with plenty of resources with the ones in need, at no cost. Sharing is caring, and this way the wastage of existing resources can be much relieved!

## Steps to use the code

Follow the given steps in order, to check the existing code.

### One Time Setup - needed only if it isn't already configured at your system
1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), if haven't already.
2. Clone this repository with `git clone <GitHub-Repository-URL>`

### Steps to be followed on every updation
1. Open a terminal at your GitHub Directory, and run `git pull` to get the latest version of code to work with.
2. Run `npm install` after every `git pull`, to ensure that all the latest dependencies are installed at your codebase.
3. Make necessary changes and updations to the code as required - you know it better.
4. Confirm your changes locally, and ensure that the code is running fine, using `node app.js` or `npm start`
5. Add the changes for commiting using `git add -A` or `git add .`
6. Commit the changes using `git commit -m <commit-message>`
7. Double ensure that there has not been any other updation on the git server from any other end, and that you will be pushing the changes over the latest updation, using `git pull`. Beware of any merge conflicts, and good luck resolving them, if any. :) 
8. Finally, push your changes to the server using `git push`.
